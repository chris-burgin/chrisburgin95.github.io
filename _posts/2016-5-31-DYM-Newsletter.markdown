### What Is It
Im excited to show off the project I have been working on for the past 3 months with Download Youth Ministry. The parent newsletter builder is designed to assist youth workers in staying in contact with parents, volunteers, students. Providing them with more time to focus on students as well as providing them the tools they need to connect people to God.



### Technology
The DYM newsletter is built with full(almost) stack javascript with expressjs powering the server side. Some other technologies include...
  - Nodejs
  - Expressjs
  - MySql
  - Jquery
  - Jade
  - Stylus

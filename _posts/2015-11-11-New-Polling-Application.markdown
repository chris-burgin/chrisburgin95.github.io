Recently I have started working on a personal project involving twitter polling. This application allows for the input of songs and creation polls which can then be presented to an audience via an external screen.

These songs can then be voted on via twitter, of which the highest will be selected and played, and then the next poll will be started.

Im currently working on this application and have made progress but Im expecting to be working on this through this christmas and be finished early next year. Ive loaded some images below, obviously this is a work in progress but much of the base is coming together.

Once I am finished I will make my github repo pupic for this project.

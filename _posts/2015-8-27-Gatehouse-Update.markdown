Recently working with [Kurt Rank](https://twitter.com/kurtrank) we have decided on the name Gatehouse for this project. We think it clearly describes the project and just sounds plain cool!

#### [View on Github](https://github.com/chrisburgin95/pigarage)
 *Checkout the readme and wiki on github for more information. There is fairly extensive documentation*

### Whats in version 0.2.0?
- Updated Code Comments
- Styling (name, font, logo)
- Small Visual Bug ([#4](https://github.com/chrisburgin95/pigarage/issues/4))
- Setup Script



### Whats Next?
Next on the list to tackle is an optional auto update feature. You can keep an eye on this feature [here](https://github.com/chrisburgin95/pigarage/issues/5) on github.

Along with this we are working on an stand alone website covering basic information about Gatecontrol. I'll have a post covering this shortly.

### Desktop version
This isn't a new feature but we just wanted to highlight that Gatecontrol is fully responsive and will work on all modern browsers. Lets skip IE 8 and below for now.

This is an update of my previous post. Ive Found a few new podcasts that Im just hooked on!



### Freakonomics
Freakonomics radio is hands down the greatest podcast Ive listened too. Hosted by a New York reporter and economist from the University of Chicago, this podcast explores the hidden world of economics. Ya, it sounds boring, but I cannot express how interesting this podcast has become. Top of my list. 10/10. Listen Now.

### Stuff You Should Know
I don't have a lot to say just yet as I just started this podcast. But so far its very promising, 700+ episodes, very interesting and the hosts have great personality and are fun to follow.

<p>With the looming election and politics around every corner I wanted to have some fun collecting some data from my friends. I wanted to figure out whether my friends leaned to the left, or to the right. With one catch, I didn’t want to ask them.</p>

<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>The data for this needs to come from somewhere, for this project its twitter. A simple python script looks for twitter usernames inputed into a mysql database. From here the script use the twitter API to fetch their userid and begin pulling in the users tweets, storing them in a database.</p>

<p>Users tweets are then parsed into single words, which are stored in a database with a foreign key linking them to the original tweet.</p>

<h2 id="left-or-right">Left or Right</h2>
<p>After collecting this data, its time to look into the users political stance. Users tweets are compared too the most used words by both republican and democratic presidential candidates.</p>

<p>The results were fairly interesting, I don’t have enough data to draw a conclusion as to whether my program is correct or not. Humans are more complex than their 140 character tweet, so it would be foolish to think I can define even their political views from so little information.</p>

    <p>Recently I was turned on to podcast by @steveostudios. Here is a list of Podcasts that I have picked in my pod catcher in my short
podcasting career.</p>

<h3 id="shop-talk-show">Shop Talk Show</h3>
<p>A self proclaimed sound effects podcast about web development. This is probably my favorite podcast. Each week Chris Collier and Dave Rupert bring on a guest from the front in web development world where they are interviewed with user submitted questions. Theres lots of episodes but start from the beginning, its worth the time to see how web development has evolved.</p>

<p><a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Visit Shop Talk Show</a></p>

<h3 id="code-pen-radio">Code Pen Radio</h3>
<p>The story behind the founding and on-going development of codepen.io. This podcast features Chris Collier, Alex Vazquez and Tim Sabat. The great thing about this podcast is that it dives into the lives of startup founders, not just code but the day to day lives of the hosts.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.codepen.io/radio/">Visit Code Pen Radio</a></p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-night-vale">Welcome to Night Vale</h3>
<p>Not a technical podcast, this is the story of a mythical town in the desert called. This podcast follows a local radio host and his bi-monthly reporting. Its probably the strangest on the list and its one of my favorites and also the first podcast I listed too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.commonplacebooks.com/welcome-to-night-vale/">Visit Welcome to Night Vale</a></p>

<p>These are my current podcast, I have a few other in my query which include <a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">History of Rome</a> and <a href="http://freakonomics.com/radio/">Freakanomics Radio</a>.</p>

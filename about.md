Hi my name is Chris, my passion is for ministry. I believe in taking the skills God has given you and using them to serve the Lord. For me those skills include Lighting Design and Web Development.

Im a Lighting designer at Southeast Christain Church, Web Developer at Big Idea Interactive and my Github is a train wreck.
